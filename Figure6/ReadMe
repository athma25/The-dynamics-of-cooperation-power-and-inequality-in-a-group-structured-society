function3.m is a Matlab implementation of the model for the case of groups with different sizes and varying degree of rivalrousness ga.
This function automatically simulates the model 100 runs and shows the results on the number contributing individuals dx, power df, and 
cooperation status dt for each group.

Fig6_data.m performs simulations that are required for the Figure 6. It uses function3 for creating data. All the output files should 
be kept in the same folder. 

Figure6.m plots Figure 6 using data created by the program file Fig6_data.m
