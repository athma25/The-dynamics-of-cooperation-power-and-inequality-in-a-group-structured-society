function4.m is a Matlab implementation of the model for the case of groups with different sizes and varying degree of rivalrousness ga.
This function automatically simulates the model 100 runs and shows the results on the number of contributing individuals dx, power df, and
cooperation status dt for each group (G=4 groups of sizes [5 10 15 n]).

Fig7_data.m performs simulations that are required for the Figure 7. It uses function4 for creating data. All the output files should be 
kept in the same folder.
